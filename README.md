# CodeFusion Frontend

A collaborative, real-time code editor web application. CodeFusion enables multiple users to join a room and edit code together, with live updates, language switching, user presence indicators, and code executionâ€”all in a modern, responsive UI.

## Features

- **Real-time collaborative code editing** (Socket.IO, Monaco Editor)
- **Room-based sessions**: Join or create a room with a unique ID
- **Live user presence**: See who is in the room and who is typing
- **Typing indicators**: Know when others are editing
- **Language selection**: Switch between supported languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java)
- **Font size adjustment** for the code editor
- **User input modal**: Provide stdin for code execution
- **Terminal output**: View stdout, stderr, status, and execution time
- **Copy room ID** to clipboard for easy sharing
- **Responsive, modern UI** (Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI)
- **Toast notifications** for user actions and errors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- A running backend server that exposes:
  - REST API endpoints: `/api/v1/code/run`, `/api/v1/code/languages`
  - Socket.IO endpoint: `/editor`
- Backend must support CORS.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subhranil002/CodeFusion-Frontend.git
   cd CodeFusion-Frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your backend URL:
     ```env
     VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
     ```

### Running the App

- **Development mode:**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

- **Production build:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run preview
  ```

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Usage

1. **Join a Room:** Enter your name and a 4-character room ID to join or create a session.
2. **Collaborate:** Edit code in real-time with others. See who is present and who is typing.
3. **Switch Language:** Use the header to change the programming language for the session.
4. **Run Code:** Click "Run Code" to execute. Provide user input if needed via the modal.
5. **View Output:** See results, errors, and execution time in the terminal panel.
6. **Share Room:** Copy the room ID and invite others to join.
